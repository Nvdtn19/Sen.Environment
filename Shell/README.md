# Shell

-   `Shell` - FrontEnd, provides a command line interface.

-   This project is a cross-platform `Rust` project that support many operating systems such:
    `Windows x64+`, `Linux x64+`, `Macintosh x64+`, `iPhone iOS 10.0+`, `Android 7+`

-   The old `Shell` was written in `C++`. However, I believe that
    [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is better in development, so the later was
    rewritten in Rust.
